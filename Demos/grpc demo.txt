Create a grpc project

Create a console application.

Right click on the console application and click Add -> Service Reference

THis will add three nuget packages to the console application:
 - Google.Protobuf   - 
 - Grpc.Net.Client   - .net client
 - Grpc.Tools        - brings in VS tooling
 
  
Also the .csproj file now  has the following code:
  <ItemGroup>
    <Protobuf Include="protos\greet.proto" GrpcServices="Client" />
  </ItemGroup>
  

You need to rebuild on the client project BEFORE you start using the new proto file as you need the file created in the obj directory

Note out that we have a using GrpcServer statement but no reference to it in the client

Remember that we need to start both projects. So set the solution to start both at the same time.

Add the following code to the Main method  
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace GrpcClient
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            var input = new HelloRequest { Name = "wael" };
			
            var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001");
            var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);
            var reply = await client.SayHelloAsync(input);
            Console.WriteLine(reply.Message);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
